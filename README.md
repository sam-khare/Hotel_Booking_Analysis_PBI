Power BI Project Introduction

This Power BI project aims to explore and visualize key business insights for a hotel by following a structured data analysis pipeline:

Build a Database: We began by creating a structured database that consolidates historical hotel data, including revenue, guest count, parking usage, and seasonal trends.

Analyze and Retrieve Data with SQL: Using SQL queries, we extracted relevant datasets to answer specific business questions and identify patterns across multiple years.

Connect Power BI to a Database: We connected Power BI directly to our SQL database to enable dynamic reporting and real-time updates as new data is added.

Visualize Data in Power BI: Through interactive dashboards and visualizations, we uncovered valuable insights to guide business decisions.

Key Business Questions Answered:
Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
Yes, the data reveals a consistent year-over-year increase in revenue, driven by both higher occupancy rates and seasonal pricing strategies.

Should we increase our parking lot size?
Analysis shows a steady rise in parking lot usage, with frequent instances of full capacity during peak seasons, suggesting the need for expansion.

What trends can we see in the data?
We identified seasonal booking trends, peak check-in days, increased demand during holidays, and a growing number of returning guestsâ€”all key indicators to guide future marketing and operational strategies.
